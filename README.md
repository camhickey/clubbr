# clubbr
clubbr is a mobile application built using React Native and Expo that aims to gives users a comprehensive nightlife experience while also encouraging safety.

## Note
This app was built as an MVP to present to investors and a mobile development team, but is currently being rebuilt under a new (yet to be published) repo with the following major changes in mind.

- Switching from Firebase to Supabase for reduced cost and because a SQL approach would be much better suited for this application.
- Replacing React Navigation with Expo Router.
- Replacing the current mapping library, react-native-maps, with rnmapbox which should allow more flexibility with what the map can actually do.
